                                                    Real-Time Video Capture with Background Subtraction
This repository contains a Python script that captures video from a webcam and applies background subtraction using OpenCV. 
The script captures an initial background and then subtracts it from subsequent frames to isolate moving objects. This simulates the effect which is similar to the "Invisibility cloak" in Harry Potter books and movies.
